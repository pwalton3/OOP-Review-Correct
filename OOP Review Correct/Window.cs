        //  Greedy constructor

        //this version of the constructor usually similates the "system" constructor
        //you CAN if you wish assign values to your class data members/properties
        //  that are NOT the system default for the datatype
        //this constructor is called on your behave when an instance of the class
        //  is requested by the outside user.
